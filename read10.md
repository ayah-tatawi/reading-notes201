Debugging
ORDER OF EXECUTION
To find the source of an error, it helps to know how scripts are processed. The order in which statements are executed can be complex; some tasks cannot complete until another statement or function has been run.
EXECUTION CONTEXTS
The JavaScript interpreter uses the concept of execution contexts. There is one global execution context; plus, each function creates a new new execution context. They correspond to variable scope.
The stack
The JavaScript interpreter processes one line of code at a time. When a statement needs data from another function, it stacks the new function on top of the curent task.
ERROR OBJECTS
Error objects can help you find where your mistakes are and browsers have tools to help you read them.

A DEBUGGING WORKFLOW
Debugging is about deduction: eliminating potential causes of an error.
BROWSER DEV TOOLS & JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE
The JavaScript console will tell you when there is a problem with a script, where to look for the problem, and what kind of issue it seems to be.
TYPING IN THE CONSOLE
You can also just type code into the console and it will show you a result.
