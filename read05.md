Images
You can use both HTML and CSS to include images on a website.

Images are very important for websites because they affect the attraction to the site and how often people are going to visit it, images should be relevant and also fits the colors of other elements of the page.

You can add an image to your page using the <img> tag with src and alt attributes.

src the link to your image which can be relative or absolute.

alt the alternative text that appears for the user in case his browser fails to upload the image or it doesn’t work.

You can also add a title attribute which will show a text describing the image which usually appears when the user hovers over the image. If your image is only for the page to look good and it’s not meaningful, then you can leave the quotes in the alt attribute empty.

You can specify the width and height to your image using the width and height attributes or you can do this in your CSS sheet.

You can place your image nearly anywhere in the page and it’s going to appear in the place you specified even if it was inside a <p> tag. The way the image is displayed depends on the elements around it. There are block and inline elements so if it is block element it’s going to appears on a new line but if it’s inline element the image will appear in the same line.

There are older codes that control the place of the image using the attribute align which can be left or right. So it would appear to the right or left of the next element. However, this attribute is no longer used in HTML5.

Some photos require you to edit them before adding them to the website and there are multiple photo editors that you can use one of them is Adobe Photoshop. But you need to make sure that the photos do not lose an important part when edited.

<fig> and <figcaption> are tags used to add a caption to the image.
