HTML, CSS, JS
lists
You can make two types of lists using html, ordered and unordered lists. According to the default style, the unordered lists are styled using the radio buttons and the ordered lists are numbered. Both ordered and unordered lists are followed by <li> tags that should contain the list items.

<dl> definition list

<dt> defined phrase

<dd> the definition

You can also create a nested link by creating a second list inside an <li> element to create a nested list.

Boxes
Each HTML element has a box with the size of its contents by default. However, you can change the size of the box around the element by using the width and height properties in CSS.

div.box { this is the selector that you use when you draw a box.

Width
You can specify the min-width and max-width of the element so that it can be displayed on different screen sizes.

Sometimes you want to specify a height for your element. But if the content is big for the box size you can use the overflow property which can hide the extra content (hidden) or make a scroll bar to view the full content (scroll value).

You can control the spaces between different element on the page by changing the margin, padding, and border.

You can also center any element by the align property and the value center.

Display:
Block takes the whole line

Inline takes just the size of the content

Inline-block is inline but with some block features

None make the content disappear, you can also hide a box by visibility property which can be hidden of visible.

Using an array, you can store more than one value into one variable. If you want to use a certain index in this array you write the number of this index but you should start counting from zero.

Switch statement are the same as if statements in terms of the job it does it’s just different syntax.

Data types can be coerced from one type to another. For example, you can change the string to a number.

All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy
0 is false and 1 is true

There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements. A for loop has a number of times that it’s going to be repeated, but the only way to exit a while loop is to have false as a result of the condition. And a do while loop is does not stop even when the condition is met.
