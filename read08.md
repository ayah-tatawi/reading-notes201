CSS
Layout
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

Block-level box: starts on a new line. Examples include: <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.
Inline box: inline elements flow in between surrounding text. Examples include: <img>, <b>, and <i>.
CSS has positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

Normal flow: Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one.

Relative Positioning: This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed. This does not affect the position of surrounding elements.

Absolute positioning: This positions the element in relation to it's containing element, which means it's taken out of normal flow and move as users scroll up and down the page.

Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.It positions the element in relation to the browser window. Therefore, when a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place.

When you use relative, fixed, or absolute positioning, boxes can overlap. If boxes do overlap, the elements that appear later in the HTML code sit on top of those that are earlier in the page.

You can use the z-index property. Its value is a number, and the higher the number the closer that element is to the front. For example, an element with a z-index of 10 will appear over the top of one.

Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box. The floated element becomes a block-level element around which other content can flow.

The clear property allows you to say that no element (within the same containing element) should touch the left or righthand sides of a box. It can take the following values:

Left: The left-hand side of the box should not touch any other elements appearing in the same containing element.

Right: The right-hand side of the box will not touch elements appearing in the same containing element.

Both:Neither the left nor right-hand sides of the box will touch elements appearing in the same containing element.

None: Elements can touch either side.

If a containing element only contains floated elements, some browsers will treat it as if it is zero pixels tall.

The pure CSS solution adds two CSS rules to the containing element:

The overflow property is given a value auto.

The width property is set to 100%.

Different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.

Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.
