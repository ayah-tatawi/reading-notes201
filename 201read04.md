## HTML
### Links
You can use HTML to link page together so it is easier to move from one page to another. You add a link to a page by the `<a>` tag that refers to anchor and `href` attribute. And between the `<a>` tags you should write a text that describes the link.

You do so much using links:

**Links from one website to another** 

When you want to link another website, the URL should be absolute which is the full address to access the website.

**Links from one page to another on the same website**

When you want to link a page in the same website, you use a relative URL which are the shorthand for the absolute URL because you’re not going to need a domain for the website.

So you need to give the name of the file only.

You can change the URL according to the place of the file in your directory so make sure that you might need a `/` or `../` to have the right path.

**Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page**

You do this using the `id` attribute (which can be used on every HTML element). 

`<a href=#links>`

**Links that open in a new browser window**

If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute after the URL on the opening `<a>`  tag. The value of this attribute should be `_blank`.

**Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone**

Email links are linked in the page by writing `mailto:the email address` after the href attribute inside the `<a>` tag.

### CSS

 `div` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page but now they are not used as before because there are some alternative tags to use.
 
 Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed **positioning**.
 
 **The float property** moves content to the left or right of the page but you should give it a width first.
 
  Pages can be fixed width or liquid layouts.
  
 **Grids** help create professional and flexible designs as it allows the user to align the page and create columns and rows.
 
 **CSS Frameworks** provide rules for common tasks and they contain grids which makes easier and more friendly webpages.
 
  You can include multiple CSS files in one page but you need to know which when you want to apply first.
  
### JS

#### Functions

Functions are used to make the script more readable and to use the block of code more than one time in the file.

You can have parameters in a function, and you can return a value.

When you declare a function, you should use the `function` keyword and then the name of the function which is better to make sense and indicates what it does. And you write the block of code after `{` curly braces. When you call it you just type its name and `()`.

If you declare a variable inside the function it’s called local and you can’t use it outside the function domain.

### Pair Programming

Pair programming means that there is a driver who writes the codes and a navigator who leads the driver but never actually writes any code. When we follow this method it’s going to be more efficient and the process of code writing is going to be much easier. It also makes the programmer more collaborative and knows when to ask for help. Not only this, but it allows the programmer to learn from other people and gain a new experience. It gives the programmer the readiness of being social and also to excel in his/her job interviews and to cope environments.
