Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
HTML
Tables
A table represents information in a grid format.

Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes.
Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. In HTML a table is written out row by row.
The <table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.

You indicate the start of each row using the opening <tr> tag. (The tr stands for table row.)

Each cell of a table is represented using a <td> element. (The td stands for table data.)

The <th> element is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.)

Example:

IMG

Sometimes you may need the entries in a table to stretch across more than one column. The colspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.

You may also need entries in a table to stretch down across more than one row. The rowspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.

For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.

JavaScript
Construction Notation
In this method we use the new with the object constructor object() creats a blank object.

After creating the empty object we can add properties and methods to it using the dot notation, with the semi-colon ending each statement.

Example:

var hotel = new Object();

hotel.name = 'Quay';
hotel.rooms = 40;
hotel.booked = 25;

hotel.checkavailability = function(){
  return this.rooms - this.booked;
};
It's also possible using the dot notaion to update these values after they are assigned.

When multiple similar objects are to be created, it's best practice to create a function that represents a template for creating objects. So the template will be holding the object's properties and methods.

Example:

function hotel(name,rooms,booked){
  this.name = name;
  this.rooms = rooms;
  this.booked = booked;

  this.checkAvailability = function(){
    return this.rooms - this.booked;
  };
}
The this keyword is used instead of the object name to indicate that the property or method belongs to the object that this function creates.

Then instances of the object are created using the constructor function.

The new keyword followed by a call to the function creates a new object. The properties of each object are given as arguments to the function.

Example:

var quayHotel = new hotel('Quay', 40, 25);
var parkHotel = new hotel('Park' 120, 77);
Once you have created an object (using literal or constructor notation), you can add new properties to it using the dot notation.

Example:

var hotel = { 
  name : 'Park',
  rooms : 120,
  booked : 77,
  }; 

hotel.gym = true;
hotel.pool = false;
delete hotel.booked;

var elName = document.getElementByld('hotelName');
elName.textContent = hotel.name; 
var el Pool = document.getElementByid('pool');
elPool.className = 'Pool: ' + hotel.pool; 
var elGym = document.getElementByld('gym'};
elGym.className = 'Gym: ' + hotel.gym; 
...
